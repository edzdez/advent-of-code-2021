# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for Advent of Code 2021. I started writing most of them in C++, but some of them just became too much of a
pain, so I started writing a few in Kotlin.

## To Build

### C++ Solutions

```shell
$ git clone "https://github.com/edzdez/advent-of-code-2021.git"
$ cd ./advent-of-code-2021
$ cmake .
$ make
```

### Kotlin Solutions

Idk, just open the folder for the day with Intellij ig.

## To Run

### C++

1. Place your puzzle input into a file in the directory with the binaries, named in the format of  
   `dXinput`, where X is the puzzle day (e.g. `d5input` or `d12input`)
2. Run the binary

```shell
$ ./dayX 
```

### Kotlin

Name the input file in the same way but put it in the root of the folder (ie day14 or day16). Then, just run it in
Intellij.
